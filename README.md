# Optimal assignment of astrobots to cosmological targets in multi-object spectrographs
Astrobots [1] collect the light coming from particular objects in cosmos aiming at the discovery of the nature of dark energy. Each astrobot needs to be assigned to a particular object associated with an observation. Since astrobots are located in dense hexagonal formations next to each other, the quoted assingment is directly impactful on the quality of their coordination in terms of completeness. This repository hosts the kernal code of the algroithm which optimally does the desired target-to-astrobot assginment. By `optimal`, we mean the simultaneous acquisition of both maximum distribution and minimum coordination [2].
